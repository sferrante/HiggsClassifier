# HiggsClassifier
This repository contains several small ML experiments on a Z → b b̄ final-state dataset that I generated using MadGraph. The notebooks explore both supervised and unsupervised classification approaches, as well as two topics of broader ML interest: **double descent** and **scaling laws**.

One notebook implements a NN classifier for distinguishing signal and background events, and includes a brief exploration of the double descent phenomenon by increasing the training duration (number of epochs) and studying how the test error behaves. Another notebook investigates neural scaling behavior by tuning the number of model parameters and observing that the loss decreases approximately as a power law. This notebook additionally uses an autoencoder to perform a CWoLa-style (Classification Without Labels) unsupervised separation between signal and background. These projects were done as exploratory exercises to understand modern ML phenomena in a physics-motivated problem.
