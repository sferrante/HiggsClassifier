This repository contains several small ML experiments on a Z → b b̄ final-state dataset that I generated using MadGraph. The notebooks explore both supervised and unsupervised classification approaches, as well as two topics of broader ML interest: **double descent** and **scaling laws**.

One notebook studies double descent by varying the model size and examining how test error behaves in the overparameterized regime. Another notebook investigates neural scaling behavior by tuning the number of parameters and observing that the loss decreases approximately as a power law. These projects were done as exploratory exercises to understand modern ML phenomena in a physics-motivated problem.
